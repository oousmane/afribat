\title{Calculate Evenness Index}
\usage{
evenness(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector of species names. Each element represents an individual of a species.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the evenness index. Returns \code{NA} if the input vector is empty
or contains fewer than two unique species.
}
\description{
This function calculates the species evenness, which is a measure of how evenly individuals
are distributed among the different species in a community. It is based on the Shannon-Weiner diversity index.
}
\note{
Evenness is undefined for empty vectors or vectors with fewer than two unique species.
The function will return \code{NA} in such cases with a warning.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Calculate evenness for a dataset
x <- c("jonesi","gambiensis","hispida","hispida","thebaica","helvum","helvum","gambianus","gambianus","pusillus","monstrosus","aegyptiacus")
evenness(x)

# Example 2: Handle edge cases
evenness(c("thebaica")) # Returns NA with a warning
evenness(character(0)) # Returns NA with a warning
