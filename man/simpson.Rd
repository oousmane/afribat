\title{Calculate Simpson's Diversity Index}
\usage{
simpson(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector of species names. Each element represents an individual of a species.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing Simpson's diversity index. Returns \code{NA} if the input vector
is empty or contains fewer than two unique species.
}
\description{
This function calculates Simpson's diversity index, which measures the probability
that two individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to different species.
}
\note{
Simpson's index is undefined for an empty vector or vectors with only one unique species.
The function will return \code{NA} in such cases with a warning.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Calculate Simpson's diversity index
x <- c("jonesi","gambiensis","hispida","hispida","thebaica","helvum","helvum","gambianus","gambianus","pusillus","monstrosus","aegyptiacus")
simpson(x)

# Example 2: Handle edge cases
simpson(c("pusillus")) # Returns NA with a warning
simpson(character(0)) # Returns NA with a warning

}
